# First commit

In this project I developed an eâ€“ecommerce site for a furniture shop (side project).

Worked on this project to understand the shopping cart functionality in e-ecommerce applications.

I used React hooks,react-router-dom,css,git

My biggest challenge was adding the routing functionality which I had to read the react-router-dom's documentation and install the package. I also used youtube to see how other developers have implemented similar functionality.
